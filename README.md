# The-Hive
Master repository for quarter 2 project, The Hive


The Hive is an interactive, customizable social network for bee enthusiasts. Users will be able to create a personal profile and upload observations of bees they've spotted and superimpose their location onto a customized map (based on the Google maps API). Users will also be able to create profiles complete with avatar, see information about bee species, and save their favorites.
